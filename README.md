# bayesian_regression_trends
A Bayesian regression analysis of suicide rate trends in the U.S. over the years 1985-2015, as part of my culminating research project for Prof. Matthew Parno's applied math course MATH 76. This project develops the theory of Bayesian regression analysis at a graduate or advanced undergraduate level and applies it to a crucial problem at the intersection of data science and public policy. 

The file master.csv contains all of the raw data used for the project.
